# Floss Organization impact

## What is this?

**Floss Organization impact** is a bunch of scripts to get useful data for analyze the impact that one organization makes in the FLOSS comunity.

## Why we do it?

Because we (our company, [[Emergya|http://www.emergya.es]]) need a way to mesure the effort and how much we really are into the FLOSS communities to keep improving and calculate de ROI.

## Is this Libre/Open Source?

**Yes**, we are doing this for us, but we believe it's useful for more companies and organizations (or even for educational purposes), so we release it from the very begining with **GPL v2 (or later)**.

## Why is this a bunch os scripts instead a proper program?

Well, it's now in a very early stage and we don't know exactly what we'll need. The only thing we know is that we need some raw and tabbed data to work with.

These scripts provide different tabbed data and test the basic datamining so we can analyse later.

It's very probably that in a close future we create a plugin/scripts based app to get it working toguether.
